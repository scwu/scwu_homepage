		<h1>Welcome to my world.</h1>
		<p>I'm a Market and Social Systems Engineering sophomore at the University of Pennsylvania born in Pittsburgh, PA and raised in Buffalo, NY.</p>
		<p>I follow educational reform, politics, tech, Apple, Quora and Ira Glass somewhat obsessively.</p>
		<p>I like to read, learn, build and write. In that order.</p>
		<p>I'm young, humble and ready to learn.</p>
