		<h1>Welcome to my world.</h1>
		<p>I'm a student in the Singh Program for Market and Social Systems Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania. <br/>Best description: it's complicated.
		<br/>It mostly means I'm torn somewhere between Computer Science, Systems Engineering, Business and Economics. <br/> It's "interdisciplinary". What an accurate description of me! 
		<p>Other than that, I don't think Penn has defined me but it's given me a lot of passion for what I do. People here inspire me because of their own passion. Passion is addictive. I came from an all-girls private Catholic school in Buffalo, NY. I didn't know a single person who could program—or even probably, a single person who could name one single programming language. When I came to Penn, it was like a light had turned on and all these people set the standard for me; a standard that wasn't even there before. I love it—I know people who resent coming from a weaker technical background—but this, this pushes me harder to learn faster and learn more. More importantly, that small Catholic all-girls high school did so much for me, technical skills apart. I tore apart novels that I cherish today, I learned Calculus there, and I learned a lot about myself. People ask me sometimes if I regret going to my high school. I don't really see that there's anything to regret. I sacrificed one set of skills for another. Both, I think, are useful.</p>
		<p>Apart from that, I learn. I love learning. It makes me a more compassionate, empathetic, better human being.<br/>More importantly, it makes me happy and that's important too! 
		<br/>My parents raised me curious and probably regretted it later. I always need to know how things work, how people work, why they work, why it is this way and not that way and I've been bombarding my parents with these questions since I could talk. <br/>I think that's why I read too much. Readability has (recently) become my best friend.
		<p>I’m a total geek for books, with weird inclinations towards too much Hemingway, Chopin, Fitzgerald, Faulkner, and Eugenides.</p>
		<p>I'm interested in politics. And I'm interested in what you think. It's frustrating for both of us, after all. I'd love to talk!</p>
		<p>I’m passionate about educational reform; I grew up in a family where education was of utmost importance. It is a depressing fact of life that not everyone is granted this privilege. Maybe we can't fix that, but there are a few things we can fix. There are a few scales we can at least start to even out. I'd like to think one day, I can change that—even a little bit. I can't imagine a life where a love of learning wasn't engrained in every aspect of my life. It has opened up so many opportunities and I am so grateful for everything. I would <em>love</em> to give that gift to someone else. As much as I'd like to think I am more talented, I <em>know</em> I'm just lucky.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I watch too much 60 Minutes, listen to too much This American Life and absolutely read too much Quora. I'm constantly seeking new documentaries to watch. It's an obssesion, ask anyone. This concerns me on Friday nights in college, sometimes. It absolutely concerns my boyfriend. And I do feel a little guilty and a lot geeky sometimes. <em>Sometimes.</em> </p>

<p>I've gone through life wanting to be an artist, a photographer, a journalist, a vet, a professor, work for the New Yorker in some capacity, be the next JK Rowling, save lives, save animals, solve problems. I'm working on the last one, now. We'll see where that goes. I like to be inspired and I like to think sometimes I inspire.</p>
<p>Finally, I'm Clara. I'm definitely a work in progress, but I'm getting there. I'm eager, humble and ready. Let's go.</p>
